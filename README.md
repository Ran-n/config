# config

BASH program made for backing up the system configuration and being able to reset the system to its previous state on a clean build.

The program uses a configuracion file ".cnf" with multiple options such as verbose, language of messages and a password for sensitive content you wish to protect.

Though this repository contains my particular config files (saved in the cnfiles folder) it can be used by everyone just by:
- Removing the cnfiles folder.
- Renaming as .cnf the cnf file.
- Editing the .cnf file.
- Editing the files in the media folder containing varios types of configuration:
    - "carpetas.csv" is the file where the folders of the home directory are designed.
    - "progs.csv" are the list of programs to be installed.
    - "scripts.csv" are the list of scripts to be downloaded.
    - "arquivos.csv" are the list of files to be saved as part of the config.

## xFCR

- Paste script
- Main script
- Test execution of main script on several paths
- Test several excludes on media/arquivos.csv file

## Improvements

- Instead of copying and then removing the excluded files, make it so they are not copied in the first place.
- Check if files where changed regards to the actual version saved in 7z files.
